# hello-world
my very first github repo

Hello! My 'real' name is Nicole, but happy to be called Nic instead ;) 

I'm here to begin my journey into learning programming - with strong interest in App development (iOS) and game programming. I have begun following P1xt's video game programming guide (Early Feb 2019).

My interest in programming/coding began in 2003 where I taught myself HTML and a small amount of CSS. I created my first website late in 2003, using only HTML.

Over the years I have dabbled in web-programming (even being paid for a couple of websites), but have now come to the conclusion that I would like to create apps and games instead!
